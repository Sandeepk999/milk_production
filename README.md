Project description: 

Milk is one of the most important and widely consumed agricultural products in the world. It is not only a significant source of nutrition but also plays a crucial role in the global economy. Accurate forecasting of milk production is therefore essential for dairy farmers, milk processing companies, and policymakers to make informed decisions. 
By using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, forecasting milk production can help to optimize production processes, reduce wastage, and ensure a stable supply of milk in the market. 
In this project, you must explore the different methods used for forecasting milk production and the importance of accurate forecasting in the dairy industry.
